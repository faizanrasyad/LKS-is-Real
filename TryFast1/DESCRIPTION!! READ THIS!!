This is my time attack attempt on making a Login Page using DB and EF

!! TIME  :: 21 MINUTES !!

1. Login Page
a. Validation:
- Empty Pass or Email
- Valid Email (Contains '@')
b. See Through Password Field
- Using a button to toggle the Password System on the Password Field
c. DB and EF
- Make the DB in the firsthand and then connecting it using ADO.NET and EF
- Note: I blanked for a few seconds when I wanted to declare: 
  public static User loggedInUser = null;

2. MainForm
a. Logout Button
- A simple Logout Button wrapped inside a Panel
b. I FORGOT OMG
- Forgot to show the User's email and name on MainForm with onLoad method.

3. Overall
a. Slow typing
b. Keeps forgetting the syntax
c. Still slow on time
